# RTL-to-GDSII-ASIC-design-of-Counter
The objective is to take a simple counter design from the RTL (Register Transfer Level) stage through to the GDSII format using Cadence tools. The tools used in this process include Xcelium for simulation and coverage analysis, Genus for synthesis, Innovus for physical design, and Pegasus/PVS for physical verification.
